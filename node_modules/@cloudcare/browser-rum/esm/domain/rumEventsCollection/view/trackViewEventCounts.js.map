Whenever\n// a child event is collected, we could look into this history to find the matching view and\n// increase the associated and increase its counter. Having a centralized data structure for it\n// would allow us to look for views more efficiently.\n//\n// For now, having a small cleanup delay will already improve the situation in most cases.\n\nexport var KEEP_TRACKING_EVENT_COUNTS_AFTER_VIEW_DELAY = 5 * ONE_MINUTE\n\nexport function trackViewEventCounts(lifeCycle, viewId, onChange) {\n  var _trackEventCounts = trackEventCounts({\n    lifeCycle: lifeCycle,\n    isChildEvent: function (event) {\n      return event.view.id === viewId\n    },\n    onChange: onChange\n  })\n  return {\n    scheduleStop: function () {\n      setTimeout(\n        _trackEventCounts.stop,\n        KEEP_TRACKING_EVENT_COUNTS_AFTER_VIEW_DELAY\n      )\n    },\n    eventCounts: _trackEventCounts.eventCounts\n  }\n}\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,SAASA,UAAU,EAAEC,UAAU,QAAQ,yBAAyB;AAChE,SAASC,gBAAgB,QAAQ,wBAAwB;;AAEzD;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;;AAEA,OAAO,IAAIC,2CAA2C,GAAG,CAAC,GAAGH,UAAU;AAEvE,OAAO,SAASI,oBAAoBA,CAACC,SAAS,EAAEC,MAAM,EAAEC,QAAQ,EAAE;EAChE,IAAIC,iBAAiB,GAAGN,gBAAgB,CAAC;IACvCG,SAAS,EAAEA,SAAS;IACpBI,YAAY,EAAE,SAAAA,aAAUC,KAAK,EAAE;MAC7B,OAAOA,KAAK,CAACC,IAAI,CAACC,EAAE,KAAKN,MAAM;IACjC,CAAC;IACDC,QAAQ,EAAEA;EACZ,CAAC,CAAC;EACF,OAAO;IACLM,YAAY,EAAE,SAAAA,aAAA,EAAY;MACxBZ,UAAU,CACRO,iBAAiB,CAACM,IAAI,EACtBX,2CACF,CAAC;IACH,CAAC;IACDY,WAAW,EAAEP,iBAAiB,CAACO;EACjC,CAAC;AACH","ignoreList":[]}
